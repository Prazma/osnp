### About this project
Modern space development and research heavily rely on nuclear power in the form of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) or nuclear batteries. Although RTGs successfully provide the amount needed for explorations by spacecraft and rovers, we still do not have the variety of models supporting crewed missions. In this research, we have aimed to develop a new nuclear power plant model with a built-in automation program. Since we are students with no financial power, we have been experimenting on a self-built simulation platform to develop and test the powerplant models and the automation program. As the final goal for our project, we are planning to share a valid nuclear powerplant model with the automation algorithm to space-related organizations for feedback and further development.
